# QuickFigures
QuickFigures is a toolset for creating scientific figures. 

If you are in a hurry you can learn the basics in less than 10 minutes with [this tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__pkILuLfzc). 
You can also watch the full length [tutorial video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Crg-FAOHmc&t=54s) for instructions or you may read the [user guide](https://github.com/grishkam/QuickFigures/blob/master/UserGuide/User%20Guide.md) which is more detailed than the full length playlist.

You can install using the 'Update...' command in Fiji and selecting QuickFigures from the list of ImageJ update sites. This will download QuickFigure and all the dependencies. If you need to perform a manual install, you can download [here](https://github.com/grishkam/QuickFigures/raw/master/QuickFigures_.jar). 

See [publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.24.311282v2) for more details

The most recent version uses the most recent version of Apache Batik (1.13) for SVG, PDF and EPS export. 

Note from the author: 
You have permission to use parts of the QuickFigures project. 
I don't expect much more than recognition and thanks. 
It is primarily for academic use by researchers at scientific institutions. In the event
that it takes off with incredible popularity, I might need to start making many improvements and
possibly start asking for help. 
Furthermore, I would be flattered if parts of my work were re-used or repurposed by others.
I am currently pushing recent changes to this repository.
The sourcecode for my journal submission is in the QuickFigures.zip file while 
the .jar file can be used as an ImageJ plugin.

Please feel free to contact me with any bug reports, questions, recommendations or comments.

Enjoy the toolset,
Gregory 

For anyone who is interested in the code, JUnit tests are in [the testing folder](https://github.com/grishkam/QuickFigures/tree/master/TestingQuickFigures). If you will be running those tests, you will need the image files in [this location](https://github.com/grishkam/QuickFigures/tree/master/TestingQuickFigures/Testing) and put them in your documents folder in '~\Documents\Quick Figures\Testing'.


PS: Some of the source code does not follow best practices for naming and explanations for how my code works are not always detailed. If you want to re-use parts of my code in your software
and have questions it may be helpful to contact me.
