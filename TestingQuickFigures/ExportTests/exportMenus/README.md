The files in this folder are designed to test export.
Some images files from the github page must be copied to the
documents folder for some of the tests to work
Although PNG export is trivial and faithful (same code that displays figures in windows creates png images)
Inconstrast, Export to vector graphic formats required more coding.  
Tests for vector formats SVG, PDF, EPS, PPT and illustrator must be checked.  
Illustrator script can be run even with an expired creative cloud license.   
SVG can be opened with inkscape, illustrator or google chrome.  
EPS may be opened with inkscape on a mac but does not appear to work with windows.
