Known issues

-Some users report slow behavior for large z stacks and some CZI files.  

-for users of Linux systems, the tools sometimes disappear from the toolbar (can be fixed by using menu option to make toolbar re-appear).

-Sometimes the crop dialog does not appear to pack correctly and image fails to appear. Calling the same menu item again results in a normal dialog.

-when a worksheet is saved and re-opened, channel colors of ImageJ images will sometimes not be preserved. 
This does not happen every time and appears to be an issue with ImageJ and not QuickFigures
